Sinlge Responsibility Principle

public class student{
    saveStudentInformation(){}
    displayStudentInformation(){}
    printStudentInfo(){}
}

In the above class there are three functions and there is high range of responsibilities 
so it voilates the single responsibility principle. In order to solve this we have to make
different class for function having low cohesion like following:

public class student{
    saveStudentInformation(){}
    displayStudentInformation(){}
}
public class printStudent{
    printStudentInfo(){}
}
